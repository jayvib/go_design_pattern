Factory Pattern:

With the Factory method, we
delegate the creation of families of objects to a different package or object to abstract us
from the knowledge of the pool of possible objects we could use. Imagine that you want to
organize your holidays using a trip agency. You don't deal with hotels and traveling and
you just tell the agency the destination you are interested in so that they provide you with
everything you need. The trip agency represents a Factory of trips.
